= Vert.x FreeMarker/SpringBoot template issue

This example reproduces an issue while rendering FreeMarker templates with Vertx/SpringBoot.

The issue is happens when spring-boot-maven-plugin 1.4.0.RELEASE is used and the maven "resources" are not copied into the root of the jar.
When spring-boot-maven-plugin 1.2.4.RELEASE version is used, everything works just fine.

To reproduce, edit the pom.xml and change the spring-boot-maven-plugin version.

To build the "fat jar"

    mvn package

To run the fat jar:

    java -jar target/springboot-example-1.2.4.RELEASE.jar
